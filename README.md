# Imagify - Terraform, ECS & CI/CD Deployment

This project demonstrates how to **deploy an AI SaaS application to AWS using Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD automation**.

The application is containerized using **multi-stage Docker builds** and deployed on **Amazon ECS**, with the entire infrastructure provisioned using **Terraform** and automated via **GitHub Actions**.

The goal of this project is to replicate a **real-world cloud deployment workflow**, covering infrastructure provisioning, container registry management, automated deployment, and secure secret handling.

# Architecture Overview

The deployment uses the following AWS services:

- Amazon ECS (Fargate) - runs the containerized application
- Amazon ECR - stores Docker images
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) - exposes the application publicly
- VPC + Subnets - networking layer
- Security Groups - network access control
- IAM Roles & Policies - permissions for ECS and CI/CD
- S3 - Terraform remote backend for state management
- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (SSM) - stores infrastructure outputs for CI/CD
- GitHub Actions
-

# Key DevOps Features

## Infrastructure as Code

All infrastructure is defined using **Terraform**, including:

- VPC and networking
- ECS Cluster and Service
- Application Load Balancer
- ECR repository
- IAM roles and policies
- Security groups
- SSM parameters
- Terraform remote state backend

---

## CI/CD Automation

The project includes **three GitHub Actions workflows**.

### 1. Infrastructure Provisioning

Workflow: `.github/workflows/infra.yml`

Triggered when Terraform files change.

Responsibilities:

- Initialize Terraform
- Plan infrastructure changes
- Apply infrastructure
- Store critical infrastructure outputs in **SSM Parameter Store**

Values are stored in SSM. This allows later workflows to **retrieve infrastructure values dynamically without re-running Terraform**.

---

### 2. Build & Deploy Application

Workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Triggered when application code changes.

Steps:

1. Retrieve infrastructure values from **SSM Parameter Store**
2. Build Docker image using **multi-stage Docker build**
3. Tag image with the **Git commit SHA**
4. Push image to **Amazon ECR**
5. Trigger **ECS rolling deployment**
6. Output the **Application Load Balancer URL**

Each deployment uses a **unique image tag**, ensuring full traceability.

---

### 3. Infrastructure Teardown

Workflow: `.github/workflows/destroy.yml`

This workflow is **manual only** and requires typing `"destroy"` as confirmation.

Steps:

1. Empty ECR repository images
2. Run `terraform destroy`

This ensures **clean infrastructure teardown without orphaned resources**.

---

# Secure Secret Management

Application secrets are **never stored in the repository**.

Instead:

1. Secrets are stored in **GitHub Secrets**
2. These secrets are passed to Terraform during `terraform apply`
3. Terraform writes required values to **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**

Example secrets used:

- MongoDB connection string
- Clerk authentication keys
- Cloudinary credentials
- Stripe API keys

This approach ensures:

- Secrets remain secure
- Infrastructure outputs are decoupled from CI/CD workflows
- Deployments remain reproducible

---

# Docker Optimization

The application container is built using a **multi-stage Docker build**.

Benefits:

- Removes unnecessary build dependencies
- Significantly reduces final image size
- Faster deployments and smaller ECR storage footprint

This reduced the image size by **~10x compared to a naive Docker build**.

## Key Learnings

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Designing AWS infrastructure using Terraform
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Deploying containerized applications on Amazon ECS (Fargate)
- Managing infrastructure outputs using AWS SSM Parameter Store
- Securely handling secrets using GitHub Actions Secrets
- Optimizing container images using multi-stage Docker builds
- Structuring infrastructure and deployment workflows separately
